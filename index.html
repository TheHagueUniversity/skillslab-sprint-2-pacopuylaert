	<h2>Who am I?</h2>
		<p>I am a <em>Calligraphy artist</em>. What I do is my passion and my passion drives me to do things. Since 2013 I have been focusing on letter types and on art related to the field. However, since the early age of 12, in 2008 I have been into the underground culture of Graffiti. I remember my mother getting mad finding by first spray cans. Now she can be happy I am more focused on painting on design objects and bodies. Competition is strong in the field. However, I believe that I can become an important name in the field. How? By continuing motivated as I have been so far.

	<h2>What do I do?</h2>
	    <p>It took time but I developed my own style. I mainly focus on letter types and on the harmony that these signs can create when combined. Harmony has gained so much importance that the physical sense of the letters lost it. In other words, what I mainly make are patterns of signs that derive from the gothic alphabet but that went way beyond it and lost physical meaning in exchange of graphical beauty.

		Currently, I am doing projects by combining the beauty of the human body with the fluent signs of calligraphy. Furthermore, I am focusing on collaborations with product designers. Since a calligraphy is something beautiful that can be applied as a texture to almost every object I see the possibility for many exciting collaborations. We live in an era where labels are being destroyed. And all the labels that exist under the word “design” are becoming one. A product designer can perfectly collaborate with a calligraphy designer. Likewise, a fashion designer can do the same and add value to his/her products. Seeing these possibilities excites me incredibly and pushes me to go on with this passion that keeps me awake at night.
